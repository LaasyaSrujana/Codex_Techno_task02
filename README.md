# Task 2: Unemployment Analysis 

This project involves analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python. The aim is to understand the unemployment rate variations across different states and time periods.

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
- Gradio – deployment of interactive web interface 

# Files Included:
- `unemployment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code
- `unemployment.zip`: Dataset file
- `unemployment_output.png`: Screenshot of the output
- `demo_video_link.txt`: Contains Google Drive link to demo video

# Features:
- Cleaned and preprocessed unemployment data for analysis
- Visualizations of unemployment rate trends over time
- Analysis by region (e.g., North, South, East) and date
- Interactive Gradio interface for real-time data exploration

# Video Demo:
